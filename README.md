# NetBox Device Type Library

## About this Library

This library is intended to be used for populating device types in [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox).
It contains a set of device type definitions expressed in YAML and arranged by manufacturer. Each file represents a
discrete physical device type (e.g. make and model). These definitions can be loaded into NetBox instead of creating
new device type definitions manually.

If you would like to contribute to this library, please read through our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) before
submitting content.

**Note: As of March 2023 Netbox-Device-Type-Library-Import has been brought into the NetBox Community Organization. We will work to get this fully supported soon.**
If you would like to automate the import of these devicetype template files, there is a NetBox Community ~~**community based**~~ python script
that will check for duplicates, allow you to selectively import vendors, etc. available here [netbox-community/Device-Type-Library-Import](https://github.com/netbox-community/Device-Type-Library-Import). ~~**Note**: This is not related to NetBox in any official way and you will not get support for it here.~~

## Device Type Definitions

Each definition **must** include at minimum the following fields:

- `manufacturer`: The name of the manufacturer which produces this device type.
  - Type: String
- `model`: The model number of the device type. This must be unique per manufacturer.
  - Type: String
- `slug`: A URL-friendly representation of the model number. Like the model number, this must be unique per
  manufacturer. All slugs should have the manufacturers name prepended to it with a dash, please see the example below.
  - Type: String
  - Pattern: `"^[-a-zA-Z0-9_]+$"`. Must match the following characters: `-`, `_`, Uppercase or Lowercase `a` to `z`, Numbers `0` to `9`.

>:test_tube: **Valid Example**:
>```
>manufacturer: Dell
>model: PowerEdge R6515
>slug: dell-poweredge-r6515
>```

The following fields may **optionally** be declared:

- `part_number`: An alternative representation of the model number (e.g. a SKU). (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
> :test_tube: **Example**: `part_number: D109-C3`
- `u_height`: The height of the device type in rack units. Increments of 0.5U are supported. (**Default: 1**)
  - Type: number (minimum of `0`, multiple of `0.5`)
> :test_tube: **Example**: `u_height: 12.5`
- `is_full_depth`: A boolean which indicates whether the device type consumes both the front and rear rack faces. (**Default: true**)
  - Type: Boolean
> :test_tube: **Example**: `is_full_depth: false`
- `airflow`: A decleration of the airflow pattern for the device. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
  - Options:
    - `front-to-rear`
    - `rear-to-front`
    - `left-to-right`
    - `right-to-left`
    - `side-to-rear`
    - `passive`
> :test_tube: **Example**: `airflow: side-to-rear`
- `front_image`: Indicates that this device has a front elevation image within the [elevation-images](elevation-images/) folder. (**Default: None**)
  - NOTE: The elevation images folder requires the same folder name as this device. The file name must also adhere to <VALUE_IN_SLUG>.front.<acceptable_format>
  - Type: Boolean
> :test_tube: **Example**: `front_image: True`
- `rear_image`: Indicates that this device has a rear elevation image within the [elevation-images](elevation-images/) folder. (**Default: None**)
  - NOTE: The elevation images folder requires the same folder name as this device. The file name must also adhere to <VALUE_IN_SLUG>.rear.<acceptable_format>
  - Type: Boolean
> :test_tube: **Example**: `rear_image: True`
- `subdevice_role`: Indicates that this is a `parent` or `child` device. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
  - Options:
    - `parent`
    - `child`
> :test_tube: **Example**: `subdevice_role: parent`
- `comments`: A string field which allows for comments to be added to the device. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
> :test_tube: **Example**: `comments: This is a comment that will appear on all NetBox devices of this type`
- `weight`: A number representing the numeric weight value. Must be a multiple of 0.01 (2 decimal places). (**Default: None**)
    - Type: Number
    - Value: must be a multiple of 0.01
- `weight_unit`: A string defining the unit of measurement. It must be one of the supported values. (**Default: None**)
  - Type: String
  - Value: Enumerated Options
    - kg
    - g
    - lb
    - oz
>:test_tube: **Example**:
>```
>weight: 12.21
>weight_unit: lb
>```
- `is_powered`: A boolean which indicates whether the device type does not take power. This is mainly used as a workaround for validation testing on non-devices (i.e. rackmount kits for mounting desktop devices) (**Default: True**)
  - Type: Boolean
> :test_tube: **Example**: `is_powered: false`

## Data Validation / Commit Quality Checks

There are two ways this repo focuses on keeping quality device-type definitions:

- **Pre-Commit Checks** - Optional, but **highly recommended**, for helping to identify simple issues before committing. (trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-yaml, yamlfmt, yamllint)
  - Installation
    - Virtual Environment Route
      - It is recommended to create a virtual env for your repo (`python3 -m venv venv`)
      - Install the required pip packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
      - Continue to the "Install `pre-commit` Hooks"
    - `pre-commit` Only Route
      - [Install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) (`pip install pre-commit`)
    - Install `pre-commit` Hooks
      - To install the pre-commit script: `pre-commit install`
  - Usage & Useful `pre-commit` Commands
    - After staging your files with `git`, to run the pre-commit script on changed files: `pre-commit run`
